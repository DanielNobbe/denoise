Types of noise (from wikipedia image noise):
- Gaussian noise: Due to thermal noise in sensor and amplification
    - Algorithms exist for this kind of noise
- Salt & pepper noise
    - aka impulse noise
    - Due to AD conversion errors, bit errors in transmission and other reasons
    - Median filter can remove it quite effectively (I guess this will have a negative effect on edge sharpness)
    - Not much info on this on wikipedia so probably not so important
    - Have seen it happen sometimes in some of my own photos, although rawtherapee has some good ways to deal with it (probably median filtering).
        pretty rare though, might also have been due to chromatic aberration?
