Types of noise (from wikipedia image noise):
- Gaussian noise: Due to thermal noise in sensor and amplification
    - Algorithms exist for this kind of noise
- Salt & pepper noise
    - aka impulse noise
    - Due to AD conversion errors, bit errors in transmission and other reasons
    - Median filter can remove it quite effectively (I guess this will have a negative effect on edge sharpness)
    - Not much info on this on wikipedia so probably not so important
    - Have seen it happen sometimes in some of my own photos, although rawtherapee has some good ways to deal with it (probably median filtering).
        pretty rare though, might also have been due to chromatic aberration?
- shot noise:
    - Poisson distribution: amount of light entering pixel is affected by the quantization of light. Since this dictates a poisson distribution, each pixel will have slightly different intensities
    - each pixel is kind of 'filled up', by a Poisson distribution scaled in probability by the intensity of that point
    - So we can either 'fill up' each pixel completely through modeling a poisson distribution, but that will take a lot of computation steps (it's a Markov chain)
        - Or can we determine directly? Cumulative probability of
