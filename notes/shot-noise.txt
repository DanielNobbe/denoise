In the very basic implementation, the poisson takes the integer values of the pixels 
and samples poisson over that.
We should instead tune the poisson to the number of actual photons hitting the sensor
Signal S = QE * N * t (where QE is quantum efficiency, N photon flux /s)
QE is dependent on the wavelength, see https://hamamatsu.magnet.fsu.edu/articles/images/quantumefficiencyfigure3.jpg
Back illuminated CCDs go up to 75% for green-red light, and slope off outside the visual spectrum
This would be a good range, let's say QE is 70%
Based on this we could convert the signal to a number of photons, e.g.
N * t = S / QE
This does not take into account the bucket effect though, which requires multiple photons to fill
up a bucket before an electron is issued / or a significant enough charge is issued.
These are called pixel wells, but this might not be the same shot noise, since ISO affects this
Although it is counterintuitive that two photons will already trigger a pixel to work..
